## if is more important than elif so make sure have correct step to check

for number in range(1,101):
    if number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0:
        print('FizzBuzz')
    elif number % 3 == 0:
        print('Fizz')
    elif number % 5 == 0:
        print('Buzz')
    else:
        print(number)
